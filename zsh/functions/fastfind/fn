# If name is the name of a set parameter ‘1’ is substituted, otherwise ‘0’ is substituted.

# If spec is one of the above substitutions, substitute the length in characters of the result instead of the result itself.
# If spec is an array expression, substitute the number of elements of the result.
# This has the side-effect that joining is skipped even in quoted forms, which may affect other sub-expressions in spec.
# Note that ‘^’, ‘=’, and ‘~’, below, must appear to the left of ‘#’ when these forms are combined.
