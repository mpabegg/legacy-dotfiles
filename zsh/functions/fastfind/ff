# Globbing Flags
# There are various flags which affect any text to their right up to the end of the enclosing group or to the end of the pattern;
# they require the EXTENDED_GLOB option. All take the form (#X) where X may have one of the following forms:

# l
# Lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case characters;
# upper case characters in the pattern still only match upper case characters.

# Glob Qualifiers
# Patterns used for filename generation may end in a list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses.
# The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern will be inserted in the argument list.
